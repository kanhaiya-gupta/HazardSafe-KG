# Knowledge Graph: The Central Intelligence Hub

## **🧠 What is the Knowledge Graph?**

The Knowledge Graph is the **central storage and reasoning engine** that connects all the pieces together. It's like the "brain" of the system that stores structured relationships between entities and enables complex queries and reasoning.

### **Core Purpose**
- **Stores**: Structured relationships between entities (chemicals, containers, hazards, etc.)
- **Connects**: Links data from RAG (extracted from PDFs) with ontology rules
- **Reasons**: Enables complex queries and relationship discovery
- **Visualizes**: Provides graph-based exploration of knowledge

## **🏗️ Knowledge Graph Architecture**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Database**: Neo4j (Graph Database)
- **Query Language**: Cypher
- **Storage**: Nodes (entities) + Relationships (connections)
- **Integration**: Connects with Ontology (rules) + RAG (data)

### **Graph Structure**
```cypher
// Example: Chemical Safety Knowledge Graph
(:ChemicalSubstance {id: "H2SO4", name: "Sulfuric Acid", formula: "H2SO4"})
-[:HAS_HAZARD]->(:Hazard {type: "corrosive", severity: "high"})
-[:IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH]->(:Container {material: "polyethylene", pressure_rating: "2.0_bar"})
-[:REQUIRES_PPE]->(:PPE {type: "acid_resistant_gloves", level: "protection_level_2"})
-[:FOLLOWS_STANDARD]->(:SafetyStandard {name: "OSHA", regulation: "29_CFR_1910"})
```

## **🔄 How Knowledge Graph Works with Ontology & RAG**

### **1. Ontology → Knowledge Graph (Structure)**
```python
# Ontology defines the schema
ontology_schema = {
    "ChemicalSubstance": {
        "properties": ["formula", "hazard_class", "molecular_weight"],
        "relationships": ["HAS_HAZARD", "IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH", "REQUIRES_PPE"]
    }
}

# Knowledge Graph creates nodes and relationships
knowledge_graph.create_node("ChemicalSubstance", {
    "id": "H2SO4",
    "formula": "H2SO4",
    "hazard_class": "corrosive"
})
```

### **2. RAG → Knowledge Graph (Data)**
```python
# RAG extracts from PDF
pdf_content = "Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is corrosive and requires polyethylene containers"

# AI extracts entities and relationships
extracted_data = {
    "substance": "Sulfuric Acid",
    "formula": "H2SO4",
    "hazard": "corrosive",
    "container": "polyethylene"
}

# Knowledge Graph stores the relationships
knowledge_graph.create_relationship("H2SO4", "corrosive", "HAS_HAZARD")
knowledge_graph.create_relationship("H2SO4", "polyethylene", "IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH")
```

### **3. Knowledge Graph → Queries (Intelligence)**
```cypher
// Complex query: Find all containers suitable for corrosive acids
MATCH (c:ChemicalSubstance)-[:HAS_HAZARD]->(h:Hazard {type: "corrosive"})
MATCH (c)-[:IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH]->(container:Container)
RETURN c.name, container.material, container.pressure_rating
```

## **🎯 Knowledge Graph Features**

### **1. Entity Storage**
```cypher
// Chemical Substances
(:ChemicalSubstance {id: "H2SO4", name: "Sulfuric Acid", formula: "H2SO4"})
(:ChemicalSubstance {id: "NaOH", name: "Sodium Hydroxide", formula: "NaOH"})

// Containers
(:Container {id: "PE_001", material: "polyethylene", pressure_rating: "2.0_bar"})
(:Container {id: "SS_001", material: "stainless_steel", pressure_rating: "10.0_bar"})

// Hazards
(:Hazard {id: "CORR_001", type: "corrosive", severity: "high"})
(:Hazard {id: "TOX_001", type: "toxic", severity: "medium"})
```

### **2. Relationship Mapping**
```cypher
// Compatibility relationships
(H2SO4)-[:IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH {temperature_max: 60}]->(PE_001)
(H2SO4)-[:IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH {temperature_max: 200}]->(SS_001)

// Safety relationships
(H2SO4)-[:HAS_HAZARD]->(CORR_001)
(H2SO4)-[:REQUIRES_PPE]->(PPE_001)
(H2SO4)-[:FOLLOWS_STANDARD]->(OSHA_001)
```

### **3. Complex Queries**
```cypher
// Find all safety measures for a chemical
MATCH (c:ChemicalSubstance {formula: "H2SO4"})
MATCH (c)-[:HAS_HAZARD]->(h:Hazard)
MATCH (c)-[:REQUIRES_PPE]->(p:PPE)
MATCH (c)-[:FOLLOWS_STANDARD]->(s:SafetyStandard)
RETURN c.name, h.type, p.type, s.name

// Find compatible containers for multiple chemicals
MATCH (c1:ChemicalSubstance)-[:IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH]->(container:Container)
MATCH (c2:ChemicalSubstance)-[:IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH]->(container)
WHERE c1.formula = "H2SO4" AND c2.formula = "NaOH"
RETURN container.material, container.pressure_rating
```

## **🤖 AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Operations**

### **1. Automated Population**
```python
# AI extracts from RAG documents and populates KG
async def populate_knowledge_graph(extracted_data):
    for entity in extracted_data["entities"]:
        # Create nodes
        node_id = await knowledge_graph.create_node(
            entity["type"], 
            entity["properties"]

        WHERE c1 <> c2
        RETURN c1.name, c2.name, h.type
    """)
    
    # Suggest new relationships
    for pair in similar_chemicals:
        await knowledge_graph.create_relationship(
            pair["c1.name"], 
            pair["c2.name"],
